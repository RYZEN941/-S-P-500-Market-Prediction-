# -S-P-500-Market-Prediction-
machine learning model to predict the direction of the S&amp;P 500 index using historical market data from 1990 to 2022 (via yfinance)

🧠 Project Overview
In this project, we aim to:

Load and explore financial market data

Extract and visualize key indicators (e.g., moving averages)

Create labels based on future price movement

Train a Random Forest Classifier to predict whether the market will go up or down

Evaluate the model's performance using common classification metrics

📂 Repository Contents
market_prediction (1).ipynb: Main notebook containing the full workflow — from data analysis to model training and evaluation.

⚙️ Key Features
Data analysis using Pandas and NumPy

Feature engineering (50-day and 100-day moving averages)

Trend labeling logic (based on future returns)

Model training using Random Forest Classifier

Evaluation with accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report

🛠️ Libraries Used
pandas

numpy

matplotlib


📈 Results
The model predicts:

Whether the market will go Up (1) or Down (0)

Classification metrics to evaluate the model’s predictive performance

✅ Future Work
Integrate more technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD)

Use time series models like ARIMA or LSTM for sequential data

Tune hyperparameters for improved accuracy

Deploy as a web app using Streamlit or Flask

seaborn

scikit-learn
